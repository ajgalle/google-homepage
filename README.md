This is a project from the_Odin_Project.  Instructions were to use only CSS3 and HTML5 to duplicate the google homepage site.  So there's bootstrap, no JavaScript, and, sadly, no functionality. HOWEVER, there is LOTS of tricky formating, like Positiion tags, clearing floats, styling links, changing form and button defaults, and lots more. 


Thank you for reading!
